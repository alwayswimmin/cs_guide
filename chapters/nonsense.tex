Tree representation of a graph. Scary.

\section{Link-Cut Cactus}

A \textit{cactus} is a graph such that any two distinct cycles in the graph share at most one vertex. Graphs that are not trees are somehow hard to characterize; a cactus is a more general kind of graph that still has some nice properties. In particular, certain tree algorithms still run in polynomial time when modified on a cactus where no such generalization to all graphs exists.

Cacti are scary.
