\chapter{Computational Geometry}

For actual geometry problems, and not graph theory problems hiding in the plane.

I'm too lazy to actually write this section right now so here are some useful links from the USACO Training Pages.

These essentially cover anything I would want to say in this chapter anyway, so I'll likely fill this chapter out last.

\subsubsection{Dot Product}

\subsubsection{$\tan^{-1}$, \texttt{atan2}}

\section{Formulas}
