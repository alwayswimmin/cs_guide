\chapter{Math}

Algorithms here exhibit a different flavor than the graph theory, string, or geometry algorithms from earlier. This chapter is placed towards the end because material here doesn't really fit in any other section or the USACO canon, \textit{not} because this material is particularly difficult.

\section{Number Theory}
