\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I am truly thankful for all my school teachers and USACO instructors, who gave me the knowledge which I wish to pass on through this text. I am grateful for Shankar and Ross, Evan, and Dr. Osborne, who separately made me believe such a task was possible. I must credit Valerie, for she was the one who drove me to really dive into and come to love computer science. Alex and Shwetark were extremely helpful with writing this text, as they provided input and helped me find problems to supplement my work. Finally, I'd like to thank all my friends and avid programmers in the TJ community. This is for all of you, and I hope you find it useful in your studies.
