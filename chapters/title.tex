\noindent Copyright, publishing, and licensing information should go here. I don't have anything fancy like that. It is of my (na\"{i}ve, privileged teenager) belief that knowledge should be free and easily accessible to ambitious high schoolers, but it is paramount to respect intellectual property and someone else's work. I ask that you use this material to its fullest potential, however you like, provided it doesn't completely butcher the philosophy with which I embarked on this project.
