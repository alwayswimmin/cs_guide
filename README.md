Usage Notes

you like, provided it doesn't completely butcher the philosophy with which I embarked on this
project.

The file evan.sty contains Evan Chen's formatting package. I've changed it to match my name,
but any other changes can be found my preamble is simply at the top of main.tex. Please leave
evan.sty untouched if possible.

Compile in Terminal using the command

pdflatex -jobname=guide main.tex
